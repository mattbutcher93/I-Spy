(If this was part of a large project, I would instead create an editor wizard 
 to handle the creation of new Spy Objects)

1. Create and fill a "SpyObjectData" ScriptableObject
2. Create new a new Prefab as a Prefab Varient of _SpyObjectBase
3. Add the SpyObjectData to SpyObject component
4. Add object's mesh prefab as a child
5. Add objects mesh to "Highlight" component if needed.
6. Resize collider
